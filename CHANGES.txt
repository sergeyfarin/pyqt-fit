   functions

 - User can specify their own design matrix to allow for non-polynomial basis
v1.1.10, 26/2/2013
 - Added Epanechnikov kernel
 - plot_residual_tests now supports nD regression
 - corrected kde in case no method is specified
 - corrected grid_eval (now works)
 - corrected weights application
v1.1.9, 18/2/2013
 - Added tests for the various modules
 - Corrected bug in sharedmem for Python 3
 - Now using print_function and relative_import futures to minimise changes between Python 2 and 3
v1.1.8, 29/1/2013
 - Corrected Cython import error in kernels.py
 - Added "from __future__ import division" in all numerical module
v1.1.7, 28/1/2013
 - Corrected installation bug
 - Started tutorial on non-parametric fitting
 - Corrected a few bugs in Spatial Averaging class
v1.1.6, 27/1/2013
 - Corrected a few issues with documentation to allow for PDF generation
 - Changed the __init__.py to remove references to pylab, so it works without GUI
 - Corrected grid code to account for weights and lambdas
v1.1.5, 25/1/2013
 - Added CDT and FFT-based KDE estimation
 - Added TriCube kernel for demonstration
v1.1.4, 23/1/2013
 - Refactored 1D KDE estimation to support multiple methods.
 - Refactored documentation to reflect this
v1.1.3, 20/1/2013
 - Added nD local polynomial regression
 - Added 1D bounded KDE estimation
v1.1.2, 11/1/2013
 - Added 1D local polynomial regression
v1.1.0, 8/1/2013
 - Curve fitting changed to match non-parametric interface
 - Unified bootstrap
v1.0.23, 6/1/2012
 - Adapted the CurveFitting to fit the new bootstrap
v1.0.22, 6/1/2013
 - Changed interface to add user functions, using objects now
 - Added start of documentation
 - Changed function and residual module loader to avoir name conflicts

 - Improved description
 - Changed dependancy from setuptools to distribute because of a problem with setuptools 0.6
v1.0.20, 5/1/2013
 - Made non-parametric bootstrap method parrallel
 - LocalLinear1D is done in Cython now
 - Use LocalLinear1D for residual analyses rather than SpatialAverage
 - Changed bootstrap method to be more general.
 - Changed the functions and residuals modules to read from the PYQTFIT_PATH environment variable the list of extra folders to analyse
 - Added Local Linar Kernel Regression method
v1.0.19, 10/12/2012 - Corrected dependency specifications.
